# Todo Web App

This is an easy Todo Web application working with my-sql and php.
I use this app in a local server to remind me what to do.
You can add to this web-app the Weather-App.

# How i can use it?

To make it work you have to set-up your database.
 - make a database called Todo
 - The table must be tasks and have 2 collumn
 - The first collumn is "id"
 - The second collumn is "task" and must be VARCHAR
 - Change on the index.php the database access information
